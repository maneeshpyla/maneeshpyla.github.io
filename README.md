Hello all,

Welcome to the world of computational chemistry.
I am Maneesh Pyla, a second-year graduate student in the Prof. Spiridoula Matsika Lab at Temple University, Philadelphia. This website is designed for people who want to learn and contribute to computational and Theoretical chemistry. As we all know, this field is a culmination of many great scientists who contributed to studying molecules by developing mathematical methods to understand molecules at the micro level to making them apply to big molecules using computational methods and techniques.
