Hello all,

Welcome to the world of computational chemistry.
I am Maneesh Pyla, a second-year graduate student in the Prof. Spiridoula Matsika Lab at Temple University, Philadelphia. This website is designed for people who want to learn and contribute to computational and Theoretical chemistry. As we all know, this field is a culmination of many great scientists who contributed by developing mathematical methods  to make them happen in real life using computational methods and techniques.

This website consists of seven major branches.
 
 The first branch is dedicated to my personal information, my current research interests, my skills, my experiences, and my publications.

 The second branch is dedicated to sources for basic Linux scripting from providing tutorials to equipping readers with notes dedicated to important and required commands in the computational field.

The third branch is dedicated to the sources for Python scripting which helps us from writing equations to solving them, making publication-quality figures using modules such as
